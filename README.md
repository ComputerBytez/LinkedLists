# Linked Lists
A simple linked list implementation.

From [a series on Linked-Lists](http://www.computerbytez.com/linked-lists-part-1/).

**Note:** This repository currently only has the include, not the results from eah week s I have previously done. I might add it in the future for completeness sake, but for now I just have the final implmentation.

Simply include LinkedList.h and use it like you would any other template:

```
ComputerBytez::LinkedList<int> list;
```

**Also note** that `LinkedList` is in the ComputerBytez namespace to keep it separate from other linked-list implementations with little to no problems.

It should be noted that the standard library has much better solutions than my list implmentation (such as `std::vector` or `std::list`). This is more for eduational purposes really.

Please open an issue if you catch any bugs.
